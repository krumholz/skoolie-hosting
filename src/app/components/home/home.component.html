        It's messy right now but it's extremely cozy in our bus in the morning with all of the drapes closed. Nick's upfront and the air is filled with the smell of coffee, the birds are chirping and our new bed is so cozy! Ahhhhh, the little things and being on the road. I went biking in downtown Ashville yesterday and the fall colors are bursting off the trees everywhere I look. I enjoy the culture here and saw some beautiful art at @horseandhero @cylonboy @indiansummerpress and also really enjoyed @thekressemporium @brockflamionceramics.

        The drive from Wisconsin to Tennessee has been gorgeous. I'd definitely enjoy this road trip every fall! Anyone else on the road enjoying this incredible view?

        The bus is starting to feel more and more like home and is also more conducive of productivity. It's good to be back on the road and chasing warm weather and free from the typical distractions. Don't get me wrong, this lifestyle is not free from distractions. In fact, it has a whole host of out-of-the-ordinary distractions that constantly challenge us to think out-of-the-box. We never get bored and we've adapted. What was once monumentally difficult or scary as f@ck is now day-to-day. We were once deeply concerned about steep mountains, whether the solar panels would hold up, simply maneuvering the bus, finding places to park, internet connectivity, engine repairs, and the list goes on. We've since learned how to utilize our engine for downhill resistance, the solar panels have stood up to their rating, Nick has gotten really good at maneuvering the bus, we have a list of backup parking options like Walmart, Casinos, Flying J, Loves, Wayside rest areas, we've tried several data plans for internet and we are much more educated about our engine. Life is good, we're enjoying it!

        Mamma K is making progress on sewing the drapes while I pack the bus for our trip to Florida! The drapes are going to be so cozy. Anyone have land in Florida we can park on, no hookups needed just a 40' spot to park?

        I mounted our bikes inside our skoolie because we were afraid they'd rust fast outside or get stolen or get damaged by harsh weather. Does anyone have advice or experience to share about how you store your bikes? For now I hope this works for us. The bikes will be mostly out of the way here until we need the space ðŸ˜‰
